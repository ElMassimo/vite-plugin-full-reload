## Why? ü§î

When using _[Vite Ruby]_, I wanted to see changes to server-rendered layouts and templates without having to manually reload the page.

Also, in _[JS From Routes]_ path helpers are generated when Rails reload is triggered.

Triggering a page reload when `config/routes.rb` is modified makes the DX very smooth.

## Installation üíø

Install the package as a development dependency:

```bash
npm i -D vite-plugin-full-reload # yarn add -D vite-plugin-full-reload
```

## Usage üöÄ

Add it to your plugins in `vite.config.ts`

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import FullReload from 'vite-plugin-full-reload'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    FullReload(['config/routes.rb', 'app/views/**/*'])
  ],
})
```

This is useful to trigger a page refresh for files that are not being imported, such as server-rendered templates.

To see which file globbing options are available, check [picomatch].

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The following options can be provided:

- <kbd>root</kbd>
  
  Files will be resolved against this directory.

  __Default:__ `process.cwd()`

  ``` js
  FullReload('config/routes.rb', { root: __dirname }),
  ``` 

- <kbd>delay</kbd>

  How many milliseconds to wait before reloading the page after a file change.
  It can be used to offset slow template compilation in Rails.

  __Default:__ `0`
  
  ```js
  FullReload('app/views/**/*', { delay: 100 })
  ``` 

- <kbd>always</kbd>

  Whether to refresh the page even if the modified HTML file is not currently being displayed.

  __Default:__ `true`
  
  ```js
  FullReload('app/views/**/*', { always: false })
  ``` 

## Acknowledgements

- <kbd>[vite-plugin-live-reload]</kbd>

  This is a nice plugin, I found it right before publishing this one.

  I've made [two](https://github.com/arnoson/vite-plugin-live-reload/pull/3) [PRs](https://github.com/arnoson/vite-plugin-live-reload/pull/5) that were needed to support these use cases.

  At this point in time they are very similar, except this library doesn't create another `chokidar` watcher.
