## Installation ðŸ’¿

Install the package as a development dependency:

```bash
npm i -D vite-plugin-full-reload # yarn add -D vite-plugin-full-reload
```

## Usage ðŸš€

Add it to your plugins in `vite.config.ts`

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import FullReload from 'vite-plugin-full-reload'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    FullReload(['config/routes.rb', 'app/views/**/*'])
  ],
})
```

This is useful to trigger a page refresh for files that are not being imported, such as server-rendered templates.

## Background ðŸ“œ

When using _[Vite Ruby]_, I wanted to see changes to server-rendered layout or template without having to manually reload the page.

Also, in _[JS From Routes]_ path helpers are generated when Rails reload is triggered.

Triggering a page reload when `config/routes.rb` is modified makes the DX very smooth.

## Acknowledgements

- <kbd>[vite-plugin-live-reload]</kbd>

  This is a nice plugin, I found it after quickly developing this one.

  I've made [two](https://github.com/arnoson/vite-plugin-live-reload/pull/3) [PRs](https://github.com/arnoson/vite-plugin-live-reload/pull/5) that are needed to support these use cases.

  If they are merged, this might become a "preset" of that library instead.
